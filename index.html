        <p>High blood pressure is very present in my family. Many of my family members have to deal with this illness
          being especially overweight even though some are not always. I have always been very keen to details and when
           I look for commonness in family members affected by high, low and abnormal BMI I notice that they are all between 40
            and 80 years old and are mostly either in overweight or obese even though there are also some that have normal weight.
            There is no Good life without good health it is important for me to understand how weight is related to high blood
             pressure and if by being under normal weight high blood pressure can be avoided to save more lives. This is how this
             research question came to my mind. It is very important for me to assess and conduct an investigation. This study will
              help me in getting a better understanding of correlation between body weights in general and blood pressure in my town.
Also an additional experiment on a topic, can always bring about improvement in researches for my country. It could be helpful to analysts
 and scientist and help in the advancement of researches concerning body weight and tension regarding at who are those that are mostly
 affected, regarding at gender, age and how high their pressure is.</p>

 <p>Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat. Obesity is not just a cosmetic concern, it is a medical problem that increases your risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers. 1(complications, 2021) Body mass index is a notion that is able to evaluate the possibility of obesity, overweight and other measures according to height and weight; a person's height and weight determines his or her body mass index. The body mass index (BMI) is equal to a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided his or her height in meters (m) squared.
•	If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.
•	If your BMI is 18.5 to 25, it falls within the normal.
•	If your BMI is 25.0 to 30, it falls within the overweight range.
•	If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.
Obesity is frequently subdivided into categories:
•	Class 1: BMI of 30 to < 35
•	Class 2: BMI of 35 to < 40
•	Class 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 obesity is sometimes categorized as “extreme” or “severe” obesity. (5)

<p aside Class = "descrip">  Figure 1.0 shows how some weight are heights variation enables us to define the obesity or underweight of someone.
  most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical inactivity. Nonetheless, body weight can also be the result of genetics,
   metabolism, environment, behaviour, and culture. We can also have genetic factors, psychological factors, medications and social issues.
    [3] (Özer et al., 2016) Some consequences of obesity are difficult with day to day living Normal tasks become harder when you are obese, as movement is more difficult, you tend to tire more quickly and you find yourself in situations of shortness of breath.
In this investigation I will be analysing the incidence between obesity and high blood pressure. High blood pressure, commonly
 known as Hypertension, occurs when your blood pressure increases to unhealthy levels. Your blood pressure measurement takes into account how much blood is passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart is pumping. (6 Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower your arteries are, the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart disease. (6) (Holland, 2020)
The chart below shows measures for normal and high blood pressure, according to the American heart association (AHA).
Doctors measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
Systolic pressure measures the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and is the top number on a blood pressure reading.
Diastolic, which is the lower number, represents the blood pressure when the heart is resting between beats.  Blood pressure is recorded
with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.The diastolic pressure
 (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. (8) </p>

      <p> the figure above how we can determine the hypertension stage of an individual.
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.

Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as: heart disease , heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, kidney disease, vascular dementia (8)
 as its name explains it is a condition in which the pressure at which a person’s blood flows in artery walls is too high. This pressure is likely to fluctuate, reach peaks and troughs depending on activities carried out throughout the day and alimentation. Normal human blood pressure must be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while high blood pressure is anything that exceeds 140/90mmHg. Low blood pressure on the other hand is any pressure below 90/60mmHg
