      <h1>The experiment starts here!!!</h1>

<h1> Variables</h1>
      <p> Independent variables: height of patients, weight of patients, gender.
Dependent variables: Body mass index, tension measurement.
Control variables: Other diseases	For more accuracy i will have to make sure that the patients used in this experiment are not affected by other diseases like anemia, tumour, etc other diseases could influence blood pressure.
Diabete	High blood pressure occurs because of narrowings of arteries,in diabetics it can be caused because of high level of glucose. I will make sure that patients choosed are not diabetics
Alcohol	Because alcohol is a significant factor that can raise hypertension, I will make sure that patients used for this analysis are not alcoholic
Tabac	Smoking tobacco can have an hypetensive effect and increase high blood pressure. Reason why I will choose patients that arenot consuming tobacco, for more reliable results
Age range	Only patients in the range 40-80 years will be analyse because that is where my focus is. Above or below it will disrupt my imvestigation
Living area	Only People leaving in douala Cameroon will be analysed. People going to the cardiovascular center may not leave here. So i will make sure they do such that I do not go out of my town for more accuracy.
Origin of the patients	Strangers from Asia, Europe or America will not be taken into consideration in this analysis if they went to the hospital I choose to prevent interacial mixture hat may reduce accuracy.
</p>
  <br>

  <h2>Materials and apparatus</h2>
      <p>-Patients Medical documents from the hospital</p>

      <h2> Safety, environmental and ethical considerations</h2>
      <p> Ethical consideration: the patients documents that were analysed are private documents and data that is part of the professional secret in between a doctor and his patient. In order to keep the patients identity private, I decided to use patients’ initials rather than their name in order to not interchange their heights, weights, tension values.
Also, their approval had to be taken before I use their information.
</p>
<br>
  <h2>Procedure</h2>
  <p>In order to carry out this experiment, i wrote a letter to the cardiovascular centre of douala bonapriso and explained my research. They were delighted to authorized me to study their patients documents. During two days, i was able to go through 50 patients documents that were randomly taken and analyse their weights, heights, gender and tensions. Because of the various tensions, i selected the last five of the year 2020 and find the average ; i did the same thing for the weights . I recorded the average weight , and tension both systolic and diastolic of the last 5 times patients went to the cardiovascular in 2020.
I decided to seperate both the male and female to investigate in their trends  while analysing them  similarly.
In the tables below are represented two tables that show for both the male and female age ranges and average tension. Because of all the various ages and for better analysis,  male and female are seperated. Age ranges of 5 years are created for better representation of data. All female patients in between this age range’s average bmi , left hand and right hand  were calculated
